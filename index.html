<div> Visualization: Project One</div>
<div> This is a visualization of one day of earthquake data overlayed with one day of storm data. The storm data is US specific, while the earthquake data is not. The earthquake magnitude minimun is 0.897 so not every earthquake is listed.</div>

<div> Visualization: Project Two</div>
<div> This visualization overlays data about job postings for soft-drink companies with the rate of adult obesity by state. The soft-drink company data was scraped using Kimono from Monster.com. This data is every job for either Pepsi or Coca-Cola posted in the last month, organized by zip code. The obesity data was accquired by "inspecting element" on a page that had a visualization about obesity data. In the visualization I wanted to differentiate between both the soft-drink type (Pepsi or Coke) and the specific company (Bottling or Manufacturing). I chose two color families to differentiate between Pepsi and Coke and then shades within that family to differentiate between Bottling and Manufacturing. For the chloropleth of obsetiy, I chose a grey scale because this visualization is already very colorful and I thought another color scale coud be distracting.

The goal of this visualization was to analyze whether the location of soft-drink companies (which was identified using the job posting location) correlated with the rate of obesity in that location. I believe that this visualization shows that there is a correlation, but that does not indication causation.  </div>

<div> Visualization: Project Three</div>
<div> This visualization is showing metro statistical areas color coded by the 2 digit Locus activity of the job with highest location quotient in that area. The location quotient was derived using Bureau of Labor statistics data. For every job in each MSA, I took the (employment of that job in that MSA/total employment in the MSA)/(the employment of that job nationally)/national employment. I then found the job with the highest LQ and removed all other jobs. 

Once I had the data, I joined the dataset of MSA, LQ, and Locus activity with a polygon shape file of MSAs. I then used the "category" wizard to color code the MSAs. The category wizard only allows for 10 categories, and we had 33 job types to reflect. I used the CartoCSS to add the other categories, but because I didn't want to distinguish between 33 categories, I grouped the jobs by activity and made similar jobs the same color. I then changed the legend to reflect these groups. I also used HTML to change the size and names of the categories.

Lastly, I added an info window which lists the MSA name, name of the job, and LQ for each MSA.  </div>
