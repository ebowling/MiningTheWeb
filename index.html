<div> Visualization: Project One</div>
<div> This is a visualization of one day of earthquake data overlayed with one day of storm data. The storm data is US specific, while the earthquake data is not. The earthquake magnitude minimun is 0.897 so not every earthquake is listed.</div>

<div> Visualization: Project Two</div>
<div> This visualization overlays data about job postings for soft-drink companies with the rate of adult obesity by state. The soft-drink company data was scraped using Kimono from Monster.com. This data is every job for either Pepsi or Coca-Cola posted in the last month, organized by zip code. The obesity data was accquired by "inspecting element" on a page that had a visualization about obesity data. In the visualization I wanted to differentiate between both the soft-drink type (Pepsi or Coke) and the specific company (Bottling or Manufacturing). I chose two color families to differentiate between Pepsi and Coke and then shades within that family to differentiate between Bottling and Manufacturing. For the chloropleth of obsetiy, I chose a grey scale because this visualization is already very colorful and I thought another color scale coud be distracting.

The goal of this visualization was to analyze whether the location of soft-drink companies (which was identified using the job posting location) correlated with the rate of obesity in that location. I believe that this visualization shows that there is a correlation, but that does not indication causation.  </div>
